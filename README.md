This is my beginning, i don't know a lot things, but I wanna try it.

First, git is very essential in my opinion, create a repository for my other computers, will make my works easier.

Then Python, I don't care with a language this moment, I wanna understand the basic of programming and structures, how to combine the logic with algorithms.
And I think Python is a great start bacause your high-level code is more familiar for a beginner.

I have a Journey now, not easier, not make my life simple, will be hard. And I want this, feel stupid, and uncomfortable. 

This is Programming, not easy, it's hard.
